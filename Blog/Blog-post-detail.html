                    <dt><p class="light-text-clr"> Flutter is a cross-platform mobile app development framework that allows developers to create high-quality, native-looking apps for iOS and Android from a single codebase.

                                <strong>Fast development.</strong>
                                Flutter's hot reload feature allows developers to see changes to their code in real-time, without having to restart the app. This can significantly speed up the development process, especially when iterating on designs or fixing bugs.
                            </li>

                                <strong> Cross-platform development. </strong>
                                Flutter apps can be built for iOS and Android from a single codebase. This can save businesses time and money by eliminating the need to develop two separate apps.

                                Flutter provides a rich set of customizable UI widgets that can be used to create beautiful and engaging user interfaces. These widgets are based on Google's Material Design and Apple's Cupertino style, so developers can create apps that look and feel native on both platforms.
                            </li>

                                Flutter apps are compiled into native machine code, which ensures that they perform as well as native apps. This is important for apps that require high performance, such as games and video streaming apps.
                            </li>

                                Flutter has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the framework's development and provide support to other developers. This community is a valuable resource for learning about Flutter and getting help with development problems.
